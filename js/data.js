        review: "Raul designed an app for me to use with my clients. It is easy to navigate, professional, and works on both the phone and on safari. I’m impressed with his creativity and specific attention to detail that he brings in the design itself. He also explained thoroughly how to work through the site and was open to input from me along the way. He communicated really well with me and continues to do so if there’s any change I want to make to how the app looks or runs.",

        review: "Raul has done a amazing job with our Life Group Softball webpage. The amount of detail he has added was above and beyond from what we requested, the update he makes to the page are lightning fast. Ever since we have done the website we have grown in member count and our members are now able to stay updated online if not able to make it to a meet. With service and performance that I have received it's a no-brainer to add this service to your business.",
